 * CANopen Service Data Object - server protocol.
 *
 * Service data objects (SDOs) allow the access to any entry of the CANopen
 * Object dictionary. An SDO establishes a peer-to-peer communication channel
 * between two devices. In addition, the SDO protocol enables to transfer any
 * amount of data in a segmented way. Therefore the SDO protocol is mainly used
 * in order to communicate configuration data.
 *
 * All CANopen devices must have implemented SDO server and first SDO server
 * channel. Servers serves data from Object dictionary. Object dictionary
 * is a collection of variables, arrays or records (structures), which can be
 * used by the stack or by the application. This file (CO_SDO.h) implements
 * SDO server.
 *
 * SDO client can be (optionally) implemented on one (or multiple, if multiple
 * SDO channels are used) device in CANopen network. Usually this is master
 * device and provides also some kind of user interface, so configuration of
 * the network is possible. Code for the SDO client is in file CO_SDOmaster.h.
 *
 * SDO communication cycle is initiated by the client. Client can upload (read) data
 * from device or can download (write) data to device. If data are less or equal
 * of 4 bytes long, communication is finished by one server response (expedited
 * transfer). If data are longer, they are split into multiple segments of
 * request/response pairs (normal or segmented transfer). For longer data there
 * is also a block transfer protocol, which transfers larger block of data in
 * secure way with little protocol overhead. If error occurs during SDO transfer
 * @ref CO_SDO_abortCode is send by client or server and transfer is terminated.

/**
 * @defgroup CO_SDO_objectDictionary Object dictionary
 *
 * CANopen Object dictionary implementation in CANopenNode.
 *
 * CANopen Object dictionary is a collection of different data items, which can
 * be used by the stack or by the application.
 *
 * Each Object dictionary entry is located under 16-bit index, as specified
 * by the CANopen:
 *  - 0x0001..0x025F: Data type definitions.
 *  - 0x1000..0x1FFF: Communication profile area.
 *  - 0x2000..0x5FFF: Manufacturer-specific profile area.
 *  - 0x6000..0x9FFF: Standardized device profile area for eight logical devices.
 *  - 0xA000..0xAFFF: Standardized network variable area.
 *  - 0xB000..0xBFFF: Standardized system variable area.
 *  - Other:          Reserved.
 *
 * If Object dictionary entry has complex data type (array or structure),
 * then 8-bit subIndex specifies the sub-member of the entry. In that case
 * subIndex 0x00 is encoded as uint8_t and specifies the highest available
 * subIndex with that entry. Subindex 0xFF has special meaning in the standard
 * and is not supported by CANopenNode.
 *
 * ####Object type of one Object dictionary entry
 *  - NULL:         Not used by CANopenNode.
 *  - DOMAIN:       Block of data of variable length. Data and length are
 *                  under control of the application.
 *  - DEFTYPE:      Definition of CANopen basic data type, for example
 *                  INTEGER16.
 *  - DEFSTRUCT:    Definition of complex data type - structure, which is
 *                  used with RECORD.
 *  - VAR:          Variable of CANopen basic data type. Subindex is 0.
 *  - ARRAY:        Array of multiple variables of the same CANopen basic
 *                  data type. Subindex 1..arrayLength specifies sub-member.
 *  - RECORD:       Record or structure of multiple variables of different
 *                  CANopen basic data type. Subindex specifies sub-member.
 *
 *
 * ####Implementation in CANopenNode
 * Object dictionary in CANopenNode is implemeted in CO_OD.h and CO_OD.c files.
 * These files are application specific and must be generated by Object
 * dictionary editor (application is included by the stack).
 *
 * CO_OD.h and CO_OD.c files include:
 *  - Structure definitions for records.
 *  - Global declaration and initialization of all variables, arrays and records
 *    mapped to Object dictionary. Variables are distrbuted in multiple objects,
 *    depending on memory location. This eases storage to different memories in
 *    microcontroller, like eeprom or flash.
 *  - Constant array of multiple Object dictionary entries of type
 *    CO_OD_entry_t. If object type is record, then entry includes additional
 *    constant array with members of type CO_OD_entryRecord_t. Each OD entry
 *    includes information: index, maxSubIndex, #CO_SDO_OD_attributes, data size and
 *    pointer to variable.
 *
 *
 * Function CO_SDO_init() initializes object CO_SDO_t, which includes SDO
 * server and Object dictionary. Interface to Object dictionary is provided by
 * following functions: CO_OD_find() finds OD entry by index, CO_OD_getLength()
 * returns length of variable, CO_OD_getAttribute returns attribute and
 * CO_OD_getDataPointer() returns pointer to data. These functions are used by
 * SDO server and by PDO configuration.
 *
 * Application doesn't need to know anything about the Object dictionary. It can
 * use variables specified in CO_OD.h file directly. If it needs more control
 * over the CANopen communication with the variables, it can configure additional
 * functionality with function CO_OD_configure(). Additional functionality
 * include: @ref CO_SDO_OD_function and #CO_SDO_OD_flags.
 */


/**
 * @defgroup CO_SDO_OD_function Object Dictionary function
 *
 * Optional application specific function, which may manipulate data downloaded
 * or uploaded via SDO.
 *
 * Object dictionary function is external function defined by application or
 * by other stack files. It may be registered for specific Object dictionary
 * entry (with specific index). If it is registered, it is called (through
 * function pointer) from SDO server. It may verify and manipulate data during
 * SDO transfer. Object dictionary function can be registered by function
 * CO_OD_configure().
 *
 * ####SDO download (writing to Object dictionary)
 *     After SDO client transfers data to the server, data are stored in internal
 *     buffer. If data contains multibyte variable and processor is big endian,
 *     then data bytes are swapped. Object dictionary function is called if
 *     registered. Data may be verified and manipulated inside that function. After
 *     function exits, data are copied to location as specified in CO_OD_entry_t.
 *
 * ####SDO upload (reading from Object dictionary)
 *     Before start of SDO upload, data are read from Object dictionary into
 *     internal buffer. If necessary, bytes are swapped.
 *     Object dictionary function is called if registered. Data may be
 *     manipulated inside that function. After function exits, data are
 *     transfered via SDO server.
 *
 * ####Domain data type
 *     If data type is domain, then length is not specified by Object dictionary.
 *     In that case Object dictionary function must be used. In case of
 *     download it must store the data in own location. In case of upload it must
 *     write the data (maximum size is specified by length) into data buffer and
 *     specify actual length. With domain data type it is possible to transfer
 *     data, which are longer than #CO_SDO_BUFFER_SIZE. In that case
 *     Object dictionary function is called multiple times between SDO transfer.
 *
 * ####Parameter to function:
 *     ODF_arg     - Pointer to CO_ODF_arg_t object filled before function call.
 *
 * ####Return from function:
 *  - 0: Data transfer is successful
 *  - Different than 0: Failure. See @ref CO_SDO_abortCode.

 * SDO buffer size.

 *
 * Value can be in range from 7 to 889 bytes.
