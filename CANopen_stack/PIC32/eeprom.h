/*
 * PIC32MX specific
 *
 * 25LC128 eeprom from Microchip is used connected on SPI2A.
 *
 * Two blocks of CANopen Object Dictionary data are stored in eeprom:
 * OD_EEPROM     - Stored is from eeprom address 0. Data are stored automatically on
 *                 change. No data corruption control is made.
 * OD_ROM        - Stored from upper half eeprom address. Data are protected from
 *                 accidental write, can also be hardware protected. Data integrity
 *                 is verified with CRC.
 *                 Data are stored on special CANopen command - Writing 0x65766173
 *                 into Object dictionary (index 1010, subindex 1). Default values
 *                 are restored after reset, if writing 0x64616F6C into (1011, 1).
