/**
 * @defgroup CO_CGI_CANlog Web CAN logging
 * @ingroup CO_CGI
 * @{
 * All CAN messages are stored into RAM buffer.
 *
 * Received or transmitted messages from CO_driver.h are inside CO_logMessage()
 * function copied into RAM buffer 'CANBuf'. Buffer is circular binary. The
 * oldest message may be in the middle of the buffer. Head contains two
 * timestamps, both represents to the same time. Timestamp in the head is always
 * older than timestamps of the messages, but not to old.
 *
 * ####Contents of CAN message log
 *  - First 16 bytes is message head.
 *  - All other are CAN messages, each message is 16-byte wide.
 *
 * ####Format of the head - TTTTMMMMYMDHMSmm
 *  - T: 32 bit timestamp in milliseconds (little endian). It overflows in 50 days.
 *  - M: Address of the oldest CAN message.
 *  - Y: Year (0-99).
 *  - M: Month (1-12).
 *  - D: Day (1-31).
 *  - H: Hour (0-23).
 *  - M: Minute (0-59).
 *  - S: Second (0-59).
 *  - m: 16 bit millisecond (0-999) (little endian).
 *
 * ####Format of the CAN message - TTTTAA0Ndddddddd
 *  - T: 32 bit timestamp in milliseconds (little endian). It overflows in 50 days.
 *  - A: 11-bit CAN address (little endian).
 *  - 0: Zero byte.
 *  - N: Number of data bytes.
 *  - d: 8 data bytes.
 *
 * ####RAM buffer access
 * Buffer is accessible via CGI function <http://host/CANlog>. It returns direct
 * copy of RAM buffer, which is in binary format. <http://host/CANlog?clear>
 * clears the RAM buffer and returns nothing. <http://host/CANlog?dump>
 * saves the the RAM buffer to disc and returns nothing.
 * Internally there are two RAM buffers. When CGI access occurs, buffer maps to
 * web server. In the same time the second buffer empties and maps to CAN
 * logging. So CGI function always returns only new CAN messages since last read.
 * RAM buffer may also be stored to file. (In case of fatal error.)
 *
 *
 * ##Emergency message logging
 *
 * Emergency messages from all CANopen devices are logged into file.
 *
 * Received or transmitted messages from CO_driver.h are inside
 * CO_logMessage() function first verified if they are emergency type. If yes,
 * raw message is first copied to temporary circular buffer 'emcyTempBuf'.
 *
 * Function CgiLogEmcyProcess() is called cyclically from main. It formats raw
 * emergency messages from temporary buffer and stores them to battery powered
 * SRAM as texts separated by newlines. SRAM contains emergency messages from
 * midnight. Contents of SRAM can be accessed via CGI function <http://host/emcy>.
 *
 * ####Contents of SRAM are copied to the file "emcy.log" on the following
 * conditions:
 *  - After midnight. (If there is more Emergencies per day then is the size of
 *     the SRAM buffer, extra emergencies are lost.)
 *  - After the CGI call: <http://host/emcy?flush>. (CGI updates the emcy.log
 *     file and returns nothing.)
 *  - On the program startup.
 *
 * ####emcy.log file contents - TT.TT.TT TT:TT:TT - NN - CCCC EE II AAAAAAAA
 *  - T: timestamp (date, time).
 *  - N: NodeId.
 *  - C: CANopen error code.
 *  - E: CANopen error register.
 *  - I: Index of error condition (stack specific).
 *  - A: Additional information (stack specific).
 * Byte order of emergency message in log file is not equal as in CAN message.
 * For more information on emergency message see <CO_Emergency.h>. First
 * four bytes in SRAM are used as a pointer, all other are as described above.
 *
 * ####Temporary buffer message format - TTTTAAAAdddddddd - 16 bytes
 *  - T: 32 bit timestamp in milliseconds (big endian).
 *  - A: 11-bit CAN address with length in MSB byte (big endian).
 *  - d: 8 data bytes.
