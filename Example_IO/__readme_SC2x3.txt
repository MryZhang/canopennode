Update location of your project for One Workbench project files.

Edit \Example_IO\.project file:
Near the end of the file set <location> tag to location of the CANopen_stack in your filesystem.
For example: <location>D:/_/Dokumenti/CANopen/CANopen_stack</location>
Relative paths don't work ???
